Refactor and Review Summary
In this code refactor, I focused on enhancing the overall architecture, code quality, and maintainability of the project, reflecting senior-level engineering practices.

Key Improvements:
Clean Architecture Implementation:
Decoupled business logic from infrastructure concerns by ensuring that core domain logic is isolated. This separation makes the codebase more modular, easier to test, and adaptable to changes.

SOLID Principles:
Applied SOLID principles across the codebase, particularly focusing on Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion. This was achieved by breaking down large classes and injecting dependencies via constructors, leading to more testable and maintainable code.

Static Analysis and Code Quality:
Integrated and addressed issues raised by static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan). The code now passes these checks with no errors, ensuring a higher standard of code quality and reducing the likelihood of bugs.

Enhanced Testing:
Expanded and refactored unit tests to cover all critical functionality. Tests were improved to be more robust, reflecting real-world use cases. This ensures the integrity of the code and helps prevent regressions.

Performance and Efficiency:
Identified and optimized performance bottlenecks, particularly in database interactions. This included optimizing queries and implementing caching strategies where applicable.

Documentation and Readability:
Improved code documentation and added inline comments where necessary. This enhances readability and ensures that the code is easier to understand and maintain for future developers.

Outcome:
The refactor resulted in a cleaner, more scalable, and maintainable codebase that adheres to industry best practices. The project is now better structured, with clear separation of concerns, improved test coverage, and higher code quality,
